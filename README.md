# SecurityPiServer
Is a platform working with the SecurityPi project, monitoring for instance temperature and motion at home.
The server platform consts of two parts. 1) A web-interface showing current status of the system, unusual
events etc, and 2) An API for reporting of events.

The platform is built on Spring and uses Json when communicating with the API.
